Project : UniqueViralDomainPair

This project aims to extract information from SUPERFAMILY regarding the
number and distribution of viral domain pairs. Of main importance is the
script DomainPaircompare.pl, which will compare sets of genomes and provide
information regarding the distribution of one in the other.

Scripts are written in Perl. There is a module in ../lib/Supfam for identifying 
all domain pairs given an input list of domain architectures.
